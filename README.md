# ☀️ Rooftop Solar Monitor

A simple Java console application developed as part of **Hackathon 1** to demonstrate basic programming concepts using a rooftop solar monitoring scenario.

The program accepts solar panel information, evaluates energy generation, and calculates total energy generated from morning and evening readings.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Rooftop Solar Monitor** collects basic information about a solar panel system and displays the entered details.

It also:

* Checks whether the energy generation is good or low.
* Accepts morning and evening energy readings.
* Calculates the total energy generated.
* Displays the calculated result.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Apply basic Java programming concepts to a real-world scenario.
* Accept user input using `Scanner`.
* Demonstrate different Java data types.
* Use conditional statements for decision-making.
* Create and use a method with parameters and a return value.
* Perform basic arithmetic calculations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **Input:** `Scanner`
* **Platform:** Java Console

## 💡 Java Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Data Types

The program uses different Java data types:

```java
int panelID;
double energyGenerated;
int numberOfPanels;
char systemStatus;
```

These are used to store panel ID, energy generation, number of panels and system status.

---

### 2. User Input

The program uses the `Scanner` class to accept information from the user.

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```

The user enters:

* Panel ID
* Energy generated
* Number of solar panels
* System status
* Morning energy
* Evening energy

---

### 3. If-Else Condition

The program checks the energy generation using an `if-else` statement.

```java
if (energyGenerated >= 10) {
    System.out.println("Good Energy Generation");
} else {
    System.out.println("Low Energy Generation");
}
```

If the generated energy is **10 kWh or more**, the program displays:

```text
Good Energy Generation
```

Otherwise:

```text
Low Energy Generation
```

---

### 4. Methods

The project uses a separate method to calculate total energy:

```java
static double calculateTotalEnergy(
    double morningEnergy,
    double eveningEnergy
) {
    return morningEnergy + eveningEnergy;
}
```

The method receives morning and evening energy values and returns their total.
